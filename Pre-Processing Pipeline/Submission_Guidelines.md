# Pre-Processing Pipeline Submission Guidelines

## Instructions for Mentees

As part of your Brain-Spy project, you are required to submit your preprocessing pipeline for the MRI dataset provided to you. Please follow these submission guidelines carefully.

### Submission Format

1. Create a folder under the "Pre-Processing Pipeline" directory with the name format: `Group_<groupno>` (e.g., `Group_1`, `Group_2`, etc.)

2. Within your group folder, include:
    - All code files used in your preprocessing pipeline
    - Any additional resources or helper scripts
    - Any output visualizations or results

3. Include a comprehensive README.md file in your group folder

### README.md Requirements

Your README.md should be well-documented and include:

1. **Introduction**
    - Brief overview of your approach
    - Problem statement
    - Goals of preprocessing

2. **Methodology**
    - Detailed explanation of each preprocessing step
    - Tools and libraries used
    - Parameter choices with justification

3. **Implementation**
    - Code structure explanation
    - How to run your pipeline
    - Dependencies and requirements

4. **Results**
    - Visualizations of data before and after preprocessing
    - Metrics used for evaluation (if any)
    - Any challenges faced

5. **Conclusion**
    - Summary of what you learned
    - Effectiveness of your approach
    - Limitations and potential improvements

6. **References**

    - List all papers, websites, and resources used in your project
    - Include links to any external resources or repositories you referenced
    - Add any research papers as PDFs in your group folder
    - Clearly cite any code, models, or techniques adapted from other sources

7. **Team Members**
    - List all group member names

### Important Notes

- Document your process thoroughly, even if you encountered issues or didn't achieve the expected results
- Include both successes and failures in your documentation
- Explain your reasoning behind different preprocessing choices
- There is no "wrong" submission as long as your approach is well-documented and your reasoning is explained

Remember that the goal of this exercise is learning. Your submission should reflect your understanding and learning journey, regardless of the final results achieved.

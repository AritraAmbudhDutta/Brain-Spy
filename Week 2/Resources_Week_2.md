# MRI Data Analysis and Visualization: Conceptual Overview



---

## 1. MRI Fundamentals and Formats

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
- MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique used primarily for soft tissue visualization.
- It produces high-resolution structural images without ionizing radiation.
- Based on nuclear magnetic resonance of hydrogen atoms in water and fat.
- Functional MRI (fMRI) measures BOLD signals to observe brain activity.

### File Formats
- **DICOM (.dcm)**: Clinical standard; includes rich metadata for each slice.
- **NIfTI (.nii / .nii.gz)**: Common in research; stores 3D or 4D volumes with affine transformations.
- **Metadata** includes: voxel spacing, image orientation, TR (repetition time), affine matrix, and patient information.

---

## 2. Loading and Parsing MRI/fMRI Data

### Python Libraries
- `pydicom`: Load and parse individual DICOM slices.
- `nibabel`: Load NIfTI files and extract metadata such as header and affine matrix.
- `imageio` (legacy): Read DICOM folders with minimal setup.

### Stacking DICOM Slices
- Sort by `InstanceNumber` or `ImagePositionPatient`.
- Combine into a 3D NumPy array.
- Maintain spatial consistency using voxel spacing and orientation metadata.

## 3. Visualization of Brain Images

### Slice Visualization
- Extract and display slices in:
  - **Axial plane**: top-down view.
  - **Coronal plane**: front-to-back.
  - **Sagittal plane**: side-to-side.
- Use `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()` with appropriate colormaps and aspect ratios.
- Add labels, titles, and colorbars for interpretability.

### Interactive Visualization
- Use `ipywidgets` sliders to scroll through slices interactively.
- Optional: use `nilearn`, `plotly`, or `vtk` for more advanced interaction.

## 4. Functional MRI (fMRI) Analysis

### Characteristics
- fMRI produces 4D data: (x, y, z, t).
- Captures changes in blood oxygenation over time (BOLD signal).
- Temporal resolution depends on TR (typically 2–3 seconds).

### Analysis Techniques
- **General Linear Model (GLM)**: Relates experimental design to observed signal.
- **Correlation analysis**: Identifies voxels matching stimulus patterns.
- **Carpet plots**: Visualize voxel intensity over time for quality assessment.

## 5. Data Registration and Normalization

- Align scans across subjects using affine or non-linear registration.
- Normalize to standard brain templates like MNI152.
- Tools: `ANTs`, `SPM`, `FSL`, and `nilearn.image.resample_to_img()`.

---

## 6. Tools and Software

- `nilearn`: For decoding, statistical analysis, and plotting of functional data.
- `SimpleITK` and `nibabel`: For handling image volumes.
- `MMVT`: 3D visualization using Blender for multimodal imaging.
- `BrainPainter`: Generate 3D colored brain regions for visual reports.

## 7. Deep Learning and MRI

- Deep neural networks can be used for segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection.
- Common architectures: 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, ResNet, U-Net, ViT.
- Preprocessing typically includes skull stripping, normalization, and slice selection.
- Explainability tools like Grad-CAM are useful to interpret model focus areas.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Load DICOM or NIfTI data into a 3D or 4D NumPy array.
2. Inspect and parse metadata (TR, affine, voxel size).
3. Visualize slices across anatomical planes.
4. For fMRI, perform temporal modeling using GLM or correlations.
5. Use carpet plots and summary stats for QC.
6. Normalize to standard template space for group analysis.
7. Explore deep learning models for classification and segmentation.
8. Visualize attention maps or activation overlays using Grad-CAM.

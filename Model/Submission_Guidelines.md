# Final Model Submission Guidelines

## Instructions for Mentees

As part of your Brain-Spy project, you are required to submit your final models for detecting Alzheimer's disease from MRI scans. Please follow these submission guidelines carefully.

### Submission Format

1. Create a folder under the "Model" directory with the name format: `Group_<groupno>` (e.g., `Group_1`, `Group_2`, etc.)
2. Within your group folder, include:

   - All model code files (training, inference, evaluation)
   - Model architecture definitions
   - Trained model weights or a clear link to download them
   - Any additional resources, helper scripts, or utilities
3. Include a comprehensive README.md file in your group folder

### README.md Requirements

Your README.md should be well-documented and include:

1. **Introduction**

   - Brief overview of your model approach
   - Problem statement (binary or multi-class classification)
   - Model goals and objectives

2. **Methodology**

   - Model architecture details
   - Training methodology
   - Hyperparameter choices with justification
   - Data augmentation techniques (if used)

3. **Implementation**

   - Code structure explanation
   - How to train and evaluate your model
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Hardware specifications used

4. **Results**

   - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)
   - Confusion matrix
   - Visualizations of results or model interpretability
   - Comparison with baseline models (if applicable)

5. **Conclusion**

   - Summary of what you learned
   - Effectiveness of your approach
   - Limitations and potential improvements

6. **References**

    - List all papers, websites, and resources used in your project
    - Include links to any external resources or repositories you referenced
    - Add any research papers as PDFs in your group folder
    - Clearly cite any code, models, or techniques adapted from other sources
7. **Team Members**

    - List all group member names




### Important Notes

- Document your process thoroughly, even if you encountered issues or didn't achieve the expected results
- Include both successes and failures in your documentation
- Explain your reasoning behind different architectural and training choices
- There is no "wrong" submission as long as your approach is well-documented and your reasoning is explained

Remember that the goal of this exercise is learning. Your submission should reflect your understanding and learning journey, regardless of the final results achieved.
